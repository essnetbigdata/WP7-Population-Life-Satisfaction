Seeking for happiness in the distance
I don't have any feelings 
I am so quiet 
I am so upset 
Feeling very depressed
I will do nothing - so discouraged
Not determined
"he foolish man seeks happiness in the distance; the wise grows it under his feet."
Will stay neutral no matter what
The day is so quiet
I am so upset 
I feel very, very, very bad today
I am completely discouraged
Indetermined
Being rich doesn't always mean having money, It means being happy with the amount you have.
No matter if it happens or not
The city is very quiet
It makes me very upset
Depression is my second name for today
I was discouraged and do nothing
Stil feel very indetermined
Being happy is a very personal thing, and it really has nothing to do with anyone else.
It doesn't matter for me
I am happy to be in such a calm and quite city
So bad that I am upset
Depressed, depressed, depressed so much
Don't have any impression on this 
It is so quite city
So upset seeing what is going on
The happiest day in my life
I don't complain just staying neutral
So happy to live in such a calm and quite city
Upset and upsetting situation
Depression is my state today
So discouraged that this happened
Bla bla bla
So happy to be here
Everything is neutral
I am so calm today
